# PROJECT: DIAGNOSIS OF COVID-19 AND ITS CLINICAL SPECTRUM
In this project, my aim is to apply and enhance my theoretical knowledge by working with a real dataset related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 and its clinical spectrum. The specific strategy involves the following steps:

 ## 1 Define a Measurable Objective:
  Objective: Predict whether a person is affected by the coronavirus based on available clinical data with a recall rate of 70%.
        
 ## 2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Objective: Gain maximum understanding of the dataset to chose a robust modelization strategy.

  - Check out the detailed EDA report for this project [here](https://github.com/youssafB/EDA-project-Cov19/blob/main/EDA%20Report).


 ## 3 Data Preprocessing:
  - Objective: Transform the data into a suitable format for building the machine learning model.
  - **Data Preprocessing Strategy**:
In my data preprocessing strategy, I adopt an iterative approach that begins with essential preprocessing activities such as encoding categorical variables and handling missing values.Following these basic preprocessing steps, I proceed to build my initial model.Based on the model evaluation and analysis, I selectively incorporate additional preprocessing steps to enhance the model. This stepwise refinement is driven by a conscious choice of preprocessing techniques tailored to the specific challenges and patterns identified during the evaluation phase.
